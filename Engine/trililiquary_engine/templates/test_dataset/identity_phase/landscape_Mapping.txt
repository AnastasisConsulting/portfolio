Transform A: Landscape Mapping
This transform establishes a foundational overview of a conceptual terrain, where meaning is mapped across structural echoes, temporal patterns, and navigational threads. Each modifier reflects a system of orientation — from recurring archetypes and time cycles to abstract cartographic signals. The elements here provide nodes, maps, and origin points that help structure an interpretive space. Landscape Mapping is less about static geography and more about dynamic relationships that evolve across interpretive time. It prepares other transforms by locating semantic anchors, routes of movement, and thematic recurrence—effectively defining the scope and dimensional logic of the system being built.
