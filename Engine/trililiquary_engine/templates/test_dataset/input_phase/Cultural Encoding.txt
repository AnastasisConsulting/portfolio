Transform B: Cultural Encoding
This transform focuses on how meaning is carried, stored, and transmitted through symbolic systems and social dynamics. It uses modifiers like cognitive mesh and memory hubs to explore networked recall and cross-referenced language. Dialect Prism introduces a polysemous lens—where single terms may split across multiple interpretations. Cultural Encoding serves as the system's brain and memory structure: it governs how references echo, how knowledge persists, and how ambiguity is clarified or preserved. It is especially attuned to glyphs, flux, and resonance—three forces that together create a signature syntax, capable of carrying intent across spaces, times, and differing reader contexts.
