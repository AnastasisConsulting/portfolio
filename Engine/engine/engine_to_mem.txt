so the decomposer llm decomposes the users original input into 7 Rhetorical Arcs To deconstruct and reconstruct any input — whether abstract, linguistic, visual, numerical, emotional, or systemic — into 7 universal logical chunks, we must define units that are domain-agnostic, reducible, and reconstructive. These chunks must serve both analytic decomposition and synthetic recomposition functions, akin to semantic atoms or logic vectors. Here is a proposed universal 7-chunk decomposition model, rooted in systems logic, semiotics, and information theory: 

The 7 Universal Logical Chunks 

1. Essence ◦ What is it fundamentally? ◦ Core identity, nature, or type. Strips away context and function to isolate what the input inherently is. ◦ Think: noun-concept, primary classifier. 

2. Form ◦ How is it structured or expressed? ◦ Shape, configuration, format, syntax. The observable manifestation or representational structure. ◦ Think: data format, expression style, topology. 

3. Function ◦ What does it do or cause? ◦ Its role, behavior, or operative output in a system. Causal consequences. ◦ Think: verb-action, system effect, procedural role. 

4. Context ◦ Where/when/how does it occur? ◦ Spatial, temporal, cultural, or situational frame in which the input appears or operates. ◦ Think: container environment, embedding scenario. 

5. Intent ◦ Why does it exist? ◦ The purpose, drive, or telos behind the input — either explicit (designed) or implicit (emergent). ◦ Think: goal orientation, systemic reason for being. 

6. Relation ◦ To what is it connected? ◦ Interfacing or interacting elements — dependencies, oppositions, hierarchies, analogies. ◦ Think: network position, relational logic, intersubjectivity. 

7. Value ◦ What significance or impact does it hold? ◦ Its qualitative or quantitative weight — affective, ethical, utilitarian, or systemic value. ◦ Think: worth, consequence, signal-to-noise, priority. 


Why These 7? • Comprehensive: Together, they form a logical totality — ontology (Essence), semiotics (Form), behavior (Function), environment (Context), purpose (Intent), systems (Relation), and evaluation (Value). •

 Bidirectional: You can decompose any complex input into these 7 and likewise reconstruct a meaningful simulacrum by recomposing from them. • 

Neutral but Potent: These chunks don't assume a domain. Yet in any domain — language, code, image, behavior, system — they map with precision. 

Example: Input = "A hammer" Chunk Value Essence Tool Form Wooden handle, metal head, hand-held Function Drives nails, breaks objects Context Found in construction, DIY, workshops Intent To enable efficient force application Relation Works with nails, part of toolkits Value High utility in manual tasks

the original input is placed as is into the x_up file at the chronological coordinate for that :page(00-99) index position of the current (saga(0-6).book(0-6).chapter(0-6)) so no inference on this yet., Then the 7 arcs would be the structured sentences needed for the tflite model and the decomp agent totals and stores the tokens used to formulate each arc as a magnitude score for influencing output and neural impact. 

then 3 separate calcs are needed to check 3 domain relkevant semantic additions to each of the 7 arcs in each of 3 tempooral phases. this creates the semantic relationships between original iunput and final output and are inclkuded at the same index as the timeline coordinates original input only instead of the x_up.json its in the y_up.json. 

Then the magnitude score plus the sum of each arcs temporal calculatrions are tallied and the arcs are then placed in a final structured .json template from highest to lowest and sent to the final llm for contextual rendering. Now before the ranking of the arcs we need a memory retrieval algorithm to texture the output with memories from the past interactions without the llm context window bloat



A decomp agent is used to determine the number of tokens in each arc (i.e., how "complex" or how much content is packed into each arc). This will generate a score that could influence the weight of each arc during later processing. no. the decomp agent takes the original user input and askes those 7 domain agnostic yet irreducible questions and unbiases and disambiguates the fuzzy inop[ut into 7 structured thoughts . whatever the amount of tokens was used from the original input to produce each arc is the magnjitude score

so the engine is domain agnostic but to adapt to as many use cases as possible i made a .json transform template that any domain can populate and instantly transform the engine into a fine tuned (for them) machine. here is one example

the pipelines are the engine and the path the arcs travel. each nodeis one of the 63 elements that are the templates semantic pieces added to each arc and every 3 nodes the tflite needs to check the arc+3 semantic chunks against the original input and somehow scoe the triad -1, 0, or +1 we can use the 0 for n/a or errored calcs too

when populating the final structured .json prompt template the scoirings of -1, 0, +1 for each triad is also sent with the arc to allow the final llm to know at which of these 3 stages of the idea that arc should have more pressence in the rendered output

like the temporal coordinate 3 vectors (0-6)can map to any grouping of 7 similar things in this process. if we take the template for instance. each of the 3 transforms can be thought of as a 3d tyransform gizmo whose axes handles are that transforms 3 modifiers and each of those with 7 tics

then you take a template and split it into 3rds you get 3 sets of 1 transform, 3 modifiers, and 21 elements each of these represents a superimposed transform gizmo its 3 axes with each their 7 tics only in one state you have the x increasing up , another the y increasing up and the last the z increasing up

oik so those axes handles 7 tics could map to a few different things and this whole system is fractally recursive so it can scale in any dimension and any direction by any exponent. the tics could be one axis the 7 arcs themselvexs another the 7 pipelines and another the final ranked order of the arcs. the 7 el;ements per phase any score where +3 to -3 is used, etc
