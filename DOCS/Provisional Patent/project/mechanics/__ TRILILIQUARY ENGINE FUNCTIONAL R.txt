🔁 TRILILIQUARY ENGINE FUNCTIONAL RECONSTRUCTION SUMMARY
🧠 Core Model

The Trililiquary is a triadic cognitive logic engine built on a 3×3×3×7 lattice:

    3 Alpha Primes → Each contains:

    3 Sub-Primes → Each contains:

    3 Processing Pillars (Input, Identity, Inception) → Each holds:

    7 Rankable Factors

→ Total structural footprint: 189 factors
🧱 UI + Processing Mechanics
🔲 Alpha Prime Region

    3 labels representing Prime Vectors (e.g. “Alpha”, “Beta”, “Gamma” — domain-agnostic)

    These are drag-and-droppable to determine Degrees of Influence (D.O.I.):

        First-Order

        Second-Order

        Third-Order

    Clicking or ranking an Alpha Prime:

        Updates an icon display (QLabel)

        Loads a text description

        Dynamically injects the 3 linked Sub-Primes into the central triadic display

🔃 Sub-Prime Triadic Expression Area

    Contains 3 triadic Sub-Primes: Input, Expansion, Nuance

    Each sub-prime “slot” shows 1 Sub-Prime at a time, navigable via arrow buttons

    Each Sub-Prime is intrinsically bound to 3 sets of 7 ranked factors (one for each pillar)

🧩 Triadic Factored Pairings – Pillar Matrix

    3 vertical columns (Input, Identity, Inception), each a QStackedWidget

    Each stacked widget has 3 pages → 1 per Sub-Prime

    Each page contains a QListWidget of 7 rankable Factors

📌 Only the visible pages (1 per column) are active

    Total visible factors: 3 columns × 7 factors = 21

    These form 7 horizontal pipelines, each pipeline formed by:

        1 factor from each phase (Input, Identity, Inception) at the same rank position

→ Active processing total: 7 pipelines × 3 factors = 21×3 = 63 processing points

🛑 Remaining 168 factors are inert until their parent Sub-Prime is activated
🔄 Functional Logic Loops

    Prime selection → loads linked Sub-Primes → which load their associated 7 factors into the correct pillar/page

    Changing Sub-Prime slot page swaps in a new list of 7 factors (but maintains 1:1 intrinsic link to that Sub-Prime)

    User ranks the 7 factors within each visible list

    Horizontal alignment of factors at the same rank index forms processing pipelines

🌀 Emergent Structure

    The 7 horizontal pipelines can be visualized as dots in lateral depth, each representing a 9-point triadic traversal

    These form the basis for idea construction, decision trees, or generative outputs

    Further behavior (like ADHD Lensing or character modulation) may shape:

        Which Sub-Primes activate

        How pipelines align

        What emergent meaning or output results
