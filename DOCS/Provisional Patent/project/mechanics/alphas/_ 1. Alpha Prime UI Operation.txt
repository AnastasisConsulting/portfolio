✅ 1. Alpha Prime UI Operation
A precise breakdown of how the Alpha Primes work in the interface — behavior only, domain-agnostic, fully definable.

🔲 Alpha Prime UI Components
Element	Description
Prime Slots (3)	Drag-and-drop QLabels representing the Prime Vector (3 draggable elements)
DOI Labels (3)	Static labels: First-Order, Second-Order, Third-Order — updated dynamically based on vector order
Image Field	A central QLabel that displays an icon or visual based on selected or top-ranked Prime
Text Field	A QLabel or QTextBrowser that displays descriptive content or metadata for the selected Prime
⚙️ Behavioral Logic
Interaction	Behavior
Drag-to-Reorder	Dragging one Prime label into a different position updates Prime Vector order and reflects new D.O.I. state
Click Prime	Selects the clicked Prime, triggers update of image and description
Reordering Complete	Updates D.O.I. labels + visual/text fields
Top Prime Auto-Focus	The First-Order (top) Prime is considered the default "focused" Prime unless one is manually selected
🧠 System Output
PrimeVector → ordered list of prime names

FocusPrime → current active or manually selected Prime

Emits:

onVectorChanged(prime_order: list[str])

onPrimeSelected(prime_name: str)

🔗 Integration Targets
This system:

Drives the D.O.I. model

Feeds: logic stack input layers

Responds to: user input or external logic override

Can load from: JSON Prime definitions, domain skins, or agent profiles

🧩 2. Alpha Prime Knowledge Across All Project Files (Modular Chunk)
This chunk collates everything we’ve locked so far about Alpha Primes from your uploaded files, design context, and directives:

🔐 Alpha Primes: Canonical Roles (Across All Files)
From UI + Design:
The Prime Vector is a triadic set of domain-agnostic influencers.

These influence decision weighting, focus dynamics, and downstream logical processing.

From schema logic:
Primes are evaluated using Degrees of Influence (D.O.I.)

First-Order: Dominant

Second-Order: Supportive

Third-Order: Residual

Prime labels are not hardcoded — they are dynamically loaded, domain-skin friendly

From concept files:
Prime Vectors feed the 7-layer stack

They are used to determine:

Current Tilt

Focus modulation

Influence of ADHD Lensing, Drift, or Conflict States

📦 Alpha Prime Core Module Structure (to build later)
# engine/primes/core_prime_vector.py

from enum import Enum
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Dict

class PrimeAxis(Enum):
    ALPHA = "Alpha"
    BETA = "Beta"
    GAMMA = "Gamma"

@dataclass
class PrimeVector:
    labels: List[str] = field(default_factory=lambda: ["Alpha", "Beta", "Gamma"])
    order: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)  # Sorted list of active prime labels
    focus: str = ""

    def reorder(self, new_order: List[str]):
        self.order = new_order

    def set_focus(self, prime: str):
        self.focus = prime

    def to_doi(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
        return {
            "First-Order": self.order[0],
            "Second-Order": self.order[1],
            "Third-Order": self.order[2]
        }
🗃️ Source Threads Unified
🔹 UI Schematics: described all layout slots and behavioral flow

🔹 Project Manifesto: emphasizes modularity, prime-based cognitive structure

🔹 Walkthroughs + PNG UI mappings: confirmed label roles, dynamic update need

🔹 Memory directives: ensured system is not tied to specific vocab (e.g., "Risk")
