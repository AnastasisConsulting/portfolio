✅ Sub-Primes are Intrinsically Bound to Their 7 Factors
🧷 Immutable Binding Rule

    A Sub-Prime is intrinsically linked to a unique set of 7 ranked factors, regardless of how the Sub-Prime is arranged, ordered, or emphasized in the UI.

🔁 Implications on Logic + UI
Component	Behavior
Sub-Prime Input, Expansion, Nuance	Are rotated or ranked, but never disassociated from their 7-factor lists
Each Sub-Prime's 7 factors	Are rendered directly beneath it, always as a fixed vertical list
Changing a Sub-Prime via navigation (arrow on top widget)	Also swaps the factor list below to match the new Sub-Prime
Dragging or reordering the factor list	Affects the internal ranking within that Sub-Prime, but not which list is shown
🧠 Structural Clarification

So for every Alpha Prime:

    It has 3 Sub-Primes:

        Sub-Prime A

        Sub-Prime B

        Sub-Prime C

Each of those:

    Has exactly 3 Phase Pillars:

        Input, Identity, Inception

Each of those:

    Contains 7 fixed, draggable Factors (initially ordered 1–7, editable)

And:

    These sets of 7 factors do not change based on the UI position of the Sub-Prime

    They are loaded from a predefined structure (likely JSON or internal registry)

📦 Data Representation Preview
@dataclass
class FactorSet:
    name: str  # e.g. "Expansion", "Bias", etc.
    input_factors: List[str]
    identity_factors: List[str]
    inception_factors: List[str]

@dataclass
class PrimeData:
    subprimes: Dict[str, FactorSet]  # 3 per Alpha Prime

# All primes loaded into:
prime_structure = {
    "Alpha": PrimeData(...),
    "Beta": PrimeData(...),
    "Gamma": PrimeData(...)
}
🎛 UI Binding Contract

    Each QStackedWidget (Input / Identity / Inception) has 3 pages

        Each page represents a Sub-Prime (1:1 mapping)

    When a Sub-Prime is selected above, it:

        Switches the page in the phase widget below

        That page always contains its 7 factors

    When a factor is dragged within a list, its new order updates the Sub-Prime's internal rank state

✅ Current State of Engine Definition (Confirmed)
Layer	State
Alpha Primes	✅ 3 total, user-ranked
Sub-Primes	✅ 3 per Prime, dynamically loaded into slots
Factor Lists	✅ 7 per Sub-Prime × 3 pillars
Binding	✅ Sub-Prime ↔ Pillars ↔ Fixed Factors is unbreakable
UI Reflections	✅ Synced via stacked widgets and listviews
