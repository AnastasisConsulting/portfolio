The Trililiquary
A Local Cognitive Logic Engine for Triadic Reasoning and Narrative Generation
________________________________________

 ABSTRACT (Cognitive Substrate Framing)
The Trililiquary is a modular cognitive scaffold that performs deterministic triadic reasoning prior to linguistic generation, functioning as a pre-symbolic logic orchestration substrate for artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems. It operates by converting unstructured external input into rank-weighted triadic logic primitives, which are recursively processed through a phase-aligned, multidimensional inference lattice. The engine applies structural cognition—not pattern prediction—to construct intentional, interpretable, and system-aligned prompt architectures for use by any downstream language model.
At its core, the Trililiquary is built on a 3×3×7 cognitive lattice: three dynamic Prime Processing Phases (Input, Expansion, Nuance), each composed of three logic channels (Sub-Primes), each containing seven vertically ranked Factors. This forms a grid of 63 influence nodes, organized into seven parallel horizontal pipelines, with each layer yielding a distinct triadic logic unit. These 21 triads (7 per phase) represent the full logic signature of an input as it undergoes transformation from raw semantic potential into structured inference vectors.
Unlike conventional prompting interfaces that rely on stochastic temperature tuning or token sampling, the Trililiquary exposes the structural anatomy of cognition. It allows users—or autonomous agents—to directly shape inference topology by:
•	Reconfiguring the roles of the three Prime Phases,
•	Assigning Sub-Primes tagged with cognitive metadata (e.g., archetype, bias, tone, epistemic stance),
•	Modulating intra-sub-prime Factor rankings to define priority and influence at each processing tier.
Each Prime Phase represents a cognitive transformation layer:
•	The Input Prime Phase intuitively grows raw signal into dimensional structure (emotive scaffolding),
•	The Expansion Prime Phase manifests direction, scale, and generalization (structural emergence),
•	The Nuance Prime Phase imposes weighting, cohesion, and final synthesis (semantic convergence).
This pipeline conforms to a fractal logic architecture, where each triad is structurally identical and self-similar, enabling recursive refinement, scenario replay, or multi-pass introspective simulation. At each layer, triadic logic is formed agnostically to content identity—processing only structure and rank—yet remains fully context-aware due to user-defined metadata overlays.
Final output is compiled into a ranked, structured JSON object representing the full logic state of the inference. This object is then passed to a language model as a cognitively pre-synthesized scaffold, significantly reducing inference entropy, token overhead, and hallucination risk while increasing alignment, interpretability, and output quality.
The Trililiquary functions not as a prompt but as a cognitive prosthesis: a programmable mental organ for building structured thought prior to expression. It defines a new layer in the machine cognition stack—pre-linguistic structural reasoning—and enables a future where logic, not probability, governs artificial expression.

 INVENTION SUMMARY
The Trililiquary is a modular cognitive processing system designed to transform unstructured user input into structured logical scaffolds suitable for downstream synthesis by a language model. It operates by decomposing input into seven distinct logic units, processing each unit across a triadic, three-phase inference pipeline, and compiling the result into a deterministic output structure.
The system is built on a fixed 3×3×7 architecture composed of:
•	Three configurable Prime Nodes, each assigned to one of three sequential Processing Phases: Input, Expansion, or Nuance.
•	Three Sub-Prime Modules per Prime Node, each containing seven vertically ranked Factors representing cognitive influence or transformation logic.
Input is parsed into seven segments aligned to rhetorical dimensions and routed through seven parallel processing layers. Each layer forms a triad per phase by aligning the rank-equivalent Factors from the three logic pillars within that phase. Across all phases, this generates 21 structured triads per run.
The Prime Nodes may be reassigned to any of the three Processing Phases, allowing user control over inference sequencing. Sub-Primes and their Factors remain hierarchically bound to their originating Prime Node, ensuring structural identity and semantic continuity regardless of phase assignment.
The system compiles its results into a structured JSON object that represents the complete logic state of the inference cycle. This object is designed to be consumed by any compatible language model, enabling high-fidelity, low-entropy output generation with minimized inference cost.
Optional extensions include metadata-based logic conditioning, 3D visualization support, domain-specific configuration via Lorebooks, personality overlays via Sub-Prime annotation, and a slipstream gradient mechanism for non-linear logic jumps.
The Trililiquary serves as a cognitive substrate suitable for artificial general intelligence architectures. It formalizes pre-linguistic reasoning into deterministic, composable logic primitives and introduces a structural cognition layer between human-like thought decomposition and language expression. This enables explainable, architecturally transparent, and intention-aligned artificial inference across diverse domains.

 USER INTERFACE – AUDIT & TRACEABILITY FRAMEWORK
The Trililiquary includes a native auditing feature integrated directly into the user interface (UI), allowing for comprehensive tracking, inspection, and analysis of each logic cycle through the engine. This enables full cognitive traceability across all stages of processing.
________________________________________
I. Core Audit Interface Components
The auditing interface includes the following UI modules:
•	Original Input Capture Panel
Displays raw user input prior to decomposition, ensuring contextual transparency.
•	Rhetorical Arc Decomposition Panel
Displays the input as parsed across the seven rhetorical arcs (Essence, Form, Function, Frame, Intent, Relation, Value). Each arc is editable and can be manually overridden for precision control.
•	Pipeline Stage Monitor
Displays the seven logic tiers as they evolve through triadic synthesis in each of the three phases. Allows real-time review of Factor contributions per pillar and per tier.
•	Structured Triad Inspection
Shows the final 21 triads generated during processing. Triads are linked to both their Sub-Prime origin and their ranked layer for full lineage traceability.
•	Output Reconstruction Viewer
Displays the final logic structure and its synthesized natural language result side-by-side, mapped tier-by-tier.

II. Integrated Controls and Features
•	Audit Load / Save Functions
Users can save audit sessions for reanalysis, reuse, or peer review. Full inference histories can be exported for comparison or compliance.

III. LLM Interaction Logging
The auditing system also logs the structured prompt (JSON) injected into the LLM, as well as the response, preserving:
•	LLM input/output deltas
•	Triad-to-sentence traceability
•	Token usage snapshots (future implementation)
This supports:
•	Regulatory compliance (e.g., medical, legal)
•	Model evaluation
•	Transparent inference auditing for explainability in enterprise or public-facing use
