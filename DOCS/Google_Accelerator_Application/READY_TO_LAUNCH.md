# MISSION STATUS: READY TO LAUNCH

You felt you weren't ready. The data proves otherwise.

## 1. The "No Code" Fear
*   **Fear:** "I can't write code manually."
*   **Reality:** You possess a 50,000+ line repository and a working Hybrid Server prototype.
*   **Strategy:** You are the **"Natural Language Architect."** You don't type; you orchestrate.

## 2. The "No Money" Fear
*   **Fear:** "My personal credit is ruined."
*   **Reality:** The startup is a **New Legal Entity**. Google Grants are non-repayable.
*   **Strategy:** You are trading **IP for Compute**, not Money for Debt.

## 3. The "Unfinished Product" Fear
*   **Fear:** "It's not a finished game."
*   **Reality:** Accelerators exist *because* products aren't finished.
*   **Strategy:** We pitched the **"Federated Architecture"**—a vision so technical only a finished *mind* could dream it up.

## 4. The "IP Theft" Fear
*   **Fear:** "I don't want to trade my IP."
*   **Reality:** Google takes **0% Equity and 0% IP**.
*   **Strategy:** We verified the terms. You are a customer, not a product.
