# Business Scaling Model: The Path to $1M/Year Infrastructure

## 1. The "Good Problem" Perspective
In Cloud Computing, a $1M/year server bill is not a debt; it is a trophy. It usually implies you are generating **$10M - $20M in Annual Revenue**.
*   **Google's Goal:** They want you to succeed so much that paying them $83k/month feels like "pocket change" because your revenue is $800k/month.

## 2. Unit Economics: The "Hybrid" Advantage
Because of your **Federated Architecture** (Local Memory + Cloud Brain), your cost-per-user is drastically lower than competitors.

| Metric | Competitor (Full Cloud) | Eideus Dawn (Hybrid) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Turns per Month** | 500 | 500 |
| **Cloud Inference** | 100% (500 turns) | 20% (100 turns) |
| **Cost per Turn** | $0.002 | $0.002 |
| **Monthly Cost/User** | **$1.00** | **$0.20** |

**Conclusion:** You are **5x more profitable** per user than a standard AI startup.

## 3. How to Reach a $1M/Year Bill ($83k/Month)

### Path A: The "Steam Hit" (B2C Gaming)
*   **Description:** Mass consumer adoption of *Final Dawn of Eideus*.
*   **Server Cost/User:** ~$0.20/month (Strategic/Cloud turns only).
*   **Users Needed:** ~415,000 Daily Active Users (DAU).
*   **Revenue:** At that scale, if 5% purchase a $10 Season Pass, your revenue is **$2M/month**.
*   **Status:** You pay Google $83k, you keep $1.9M. **Google is happy, You are rich.**

### Path B: The "City SeCUReD" Contract (B2B Enterprise)
*   **Description:** Selling the simulation engine to Urban Planning / Smart City govts.
*   **Compute Load:** Extremely High. Simulating 100,000 citizens in real-time.
*   **Server Cost/City:** ~$10,000/month (Massive parallel simulations).
*   **Clients Needed:** Only **8 Major Cities**.
*   **Revenue:** Enterprise contracts are typically $500k - $1M per year per city.
*   **Status:** 8 Cities = $8M Revenue vs $1M Cloud Bill.

## 4. The Accelerator Strategy
Google provides the **$350,000 Credits** (approx 4 years of runway at start) to bridge the gap.
1.  **Year 1 (Credits):** You pay $0. You build the user base to 50k players.
2.  **Year 2 (Growth):** Revenue starts coming in ($30 Game Sales). You move off credits.
3.  **Year 3 (Scale):** You hit 500k players. You pay Google $1M/yr, but you are earning $20M/yr.
