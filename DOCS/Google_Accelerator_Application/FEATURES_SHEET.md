# Product Features: The G-ynthetic Suite

## 1. G_ynthetic: The Core Infrastructure
**"Holographic Memory for LLMs"**
*   **7x7x7 Lattice Storage:** Physically maps conversation nodes into a 3D cube (343 nodes) for spatial relationship tracking.
*   **Quantum Slice Retrieval:** Uses vector embeddings to "slice" through the cube, retrieving 49 contextually relevant memories instantly instead of linear history.
*   **Six-Face Data Nodes:** Each node stores Input, Output, Scene, Tags, Names, and Vector Embedding.
*   **React Module:** Deployed as a portable hook (`useMemoryCore`) for any application.

## 2. Eideus Dawn: The flagship Simulation
**"Emergent Artificial Life Engine"**
*   **Federated Hybrid Architecture:** Runs reactive AI locally (Vector/Lattice) and strategic AI on Google Vertex AI (Gemini Pro).
*   **M.O.S.S. System:** Emotional state machine (Motive Operandi Style System) that overrides dialogue generation.
*   **High-Density UI:** Professional 20/60/20 grid layout inspired by aerospace HUDs.
*   **Vizzy Protocol:** Non-verbal AI companion with autonomous "Physical Agency" logic.

## 3. City SeCUReD: The Enterprise OS
**"Cognitive Smart City Operating System"**
*   **Siege Mode:** Emergency protocol that locks the Immutable Registry and shifts resource allocation to survival priorities.
*   **Auditing Engine:** Runs simulated "CFC" (Critical Function Call) and "FSM" (Failover) checks every 3 seconds.
*   **Circadian Rhythm:** The system "Sleeps" (Consolidation/REM cycles) to process data and run dream-state simulations.
*   **Dream-State Simulation:** Spawns hypothetical crisis scenarios during REM cycles to test city resilience without real-world risk.

## 4. OrbitGen-AI: The Asset Pipeline
**"Procedural World Builder"**
*   **Google AI Studio Integration:** Generates entire star systems from text prompts.
*   **Scientific Plausibility:** Calculates orbital mechanics, atmospheric composition, and civilization history automatically.
*   **Instant Export:** Outputs JSON-ready assets for the Eideus runtime.

## 5. Cubex: The Logic Engine
**"3D Tensor-Field Strategy Prototype"**
*   **HyperBoard:** 8x8x8 Voxel Grid for 3D spatial strategy.
*   **Fractal Knight:** Recursive geometry movement logic.
*   **Vantage Chat:** LLM-integrated interrogation system allowing players to ask pieces about their tactical status.
