# Financial Reality Check: You vs. The Startup

## 1. The "Clean Start" Protocol (C-Corp / LLC)
**You are not your business.** This is the most important rule of entrepreneurship.
When you incorporate Eideus Dawn (e.g., as a Delaware C-Corp), you create a **New Legal Entity**.
*   **The Entity (Eideus Dawn Inc.)** has its own Tax ID (EIN).
*   **The Entity** has its own Credit History (which starts at 0, perfectly clean).
*   **The Entity** is what Google deals with.

**Your personal credit score does not define the startup's potential.** Investors and Accelerators know that founders are often "cash poor." They are betting on your **Intellectual Property (Code)**, not your FICO score.

## 2. Google Credits are a "Grant," Not a "Loan"
The $350,000 in Google Cloud Credits is **NOT** a loan.
*   **You do not pay it back.**
*   **There is no interest.**
*   **If the startup fails, you do not owe them $350k.**

Think of it like a **Gift Card** for servers. If you use it, great. If you don't, it expires. It never touches your personal debt.

## 3. The "Founder's Salary"
In a funded startup (even pre-seed), the goal is to get capitalization so the **Company pays YOU a salary.**
*   The business raises money or earns revenue.
*   The business pays "Employee #1" (You) a stable wage.
*   This stable wage is what eventually fixes your personal credit.

## 4. Summary
**Your past financial trauma is irrelevant to the code.** The *Memory Lattice* doesn't care about your credit score. The *Orchestrator Core* runs regardless of your bank balance.
This Accelerator is the **break** you have been waiting for—a way to separate your personal history from your professional future.
