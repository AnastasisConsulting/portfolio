## 1. The Hook (0:00 - 0:15)
"Most AI games feel like a dream—hallucinatory and forgetful. I've built Eideus Dawn to solve that. It is a persistent, deterministic universe powered by a custom-built 6D Memory Lattice."

## 2. The Architecture (0:15 - 0:45)
*   **Show: The MainGrid UI**
*   "We aren't just prompting an LLM. We use a **Modular Orchestrator Core** that decouples logic from inference. Every user action is decomposed into seven rhetorical arcs and filtered through our Affinity System."
*   "This ripples state changes from the Galaxy level down to individual City Districts using Fractal Templates. The system is provider-agnostic—running locally on Llama 3 or scaling up to Gemini Pro models."

## 3. The Character Agency (0:45 - 1:15)
*   **Show: Vizzy (Autonomous behavior)**
*   "Meet Vizzy. He is a non-verbal AI companion. Instead of chatty 'AI slop,' his agency is driven by emotional state overrides. When you turn off the laser, he doesn't just 'idle'—he enters a frantic 3-second search state based on feline hunting patterns."
*   "This makes the world feel reactive and alive without the overhead of massive server-side processing."

## 4. The Stability & Scalability (1:15 - 1:45)
*   **Show: High-Density UI / Warp Sequence**
*   "Our 'Professional Sleek' UI is designed for high-density information. It's locked to a strict 20/60/20 grid to maintain the aesthetic of a professional aerospace workstation."
*   "Because we leverage WebGPU, the game scales to thousands of players with zero server compute costs. The user's machine becomes the thinking engine."

## 5. The Closing Pitch (1:45 - 2:00)
"I've spent 16 months building this infrastructure solo. I have the vertical slice—Aura-507—ready with hand-crafted lore. Now, I'm looking for the infrastructure support to move this from my local machine to the global stage."

### Key Technical Phrases to Keep in your Pocket:
*   **"Deterministic Narrative Anchor"**: Use this when they ask about hallucinations.
*   **"Epistemic Discipline"**: Use this when they ask why the AI feels so coherent.
*   **"Fractal State Propagation"**: Use this when they ask how big the world can get.
*   **"Recursive Hypercube Address Space"**: Use this to sound like a Senior Architect (it's true, and it sounds impressive).
