# Confidentiality Brief: Application vs. Open Source

## 1. No, It Is NOT Open Source
Submitting an application to the Google for Startups Accelerator is **Private and Confidential**, effectively a Non-Disclosure scenario between you (the Applicant) and Google (the Reviewer).
*   **It does NOT:** Publish your code to the internet.
*   **It does NOT:** Grant an Open Source License (like MIT/GPL) to the public.
*   **It does NOT:** Allow other people to see your ideas.

Only the specific Google Review Committee sees it. They review thousands of applications; they are legally bound to confidentiality to maintain the program's reputation.

## 2. Defining "Prior Art" (Protection)
When I mentioned "Prior Art" earlier, I meant **Provable Existence**, not Public Domain.
*   By submitting, you create a digital timestamp proving: *"William Wallace Morehead invented the 'Spontaneous Association' protocol on Feb 12, 2026."*
*   If someone tries to patent it later, you have proof you did it first. This protects you *without* giving the blueprint to the world.

## 3. How to Mark Your Documents
To be absolutely safe, you can add this header to your Executive Summary or Research Thesis:

> **CONFIDENTIAL & PROPRIETARY**
> This document contains trade secrets and proprietary research belonging to William Wallace Morehead (G-ynthetic). Unauthorized distribution or disclosure is prohibited.

## Conclusion
You are safe.
*   **Application = Private Submission.**
*   **Open Source = Public GitHub Repository.**
*   **You represent the former.**
